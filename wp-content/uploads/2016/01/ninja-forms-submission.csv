 My name is Connor and I am currently serving as a co director for the Husky Startup Challenge on the entrepreneurs club board. I was thinking about starting a venture and wanted to find out more on how IDEA can help. I know that there is an informational orientation on the 9th and I was wondering what I should bring and if you would recommend meeting one on one with an IDEA coach ahead of time. Let me know your thoughts when you get a chance. 

Best Regards,

Connor Gross"
