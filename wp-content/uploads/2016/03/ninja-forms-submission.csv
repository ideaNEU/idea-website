I am interested in creating a new business. I already have a partner who is an engineer and has already begun developing a prototype version of our product. The reason I am contacting you is because I am unable to attend one of the orientations, as I am abroad in the International Business program (in Spain). Unfortunately, I do not return until mid-August. However, I do not want to wait that long to get things moving, and I am very interested in obtaining a patent to protect the idea (I have reviewed what qualifies for a patent, and I believe my idea does). What I need is guidance in obtaining a patent/getting a patent lawyer. I am also interested in seeing what resources Idea can offer in getting things going. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to start this venture without being at Northeastern in person. "
