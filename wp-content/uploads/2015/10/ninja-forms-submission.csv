I was looking to come to the orientation on Nov 11th but wanted to confirm the day of the week the orientation is held on. It says on the events page that orientations are held every two weeks on Tuesday, but the 11th is a Wednesday. Could you please confirm which day the orientation will be held on?

Thanks,

Brandon"
